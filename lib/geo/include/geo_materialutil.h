// * @brief The material util provides functions that deal with with materials.
// * In this case the util is more a factory class.
// *
// * An important design decision is that all uniform properties are stored in uniform blocks.
// * Some of those uniform blocks are shared between the same type of materials, or even between
// * different materials. Think about the ModelViewProjection matrices between different materials.
// * Uniform blocks appear in two variants:
// * - Internal uniform parameters: material properties for the material. They are adjusted per material, such as the color, the shininess, etc.
// * - External uniform parameters: they are under control of the material system. The user should not need to know about these properties.
// *
// * Dealing with materials can be tricky. The following situations may be wanted:
// * - Unique materials: Changing the properties does not affect the appearance of other materials using the same shaders.
// * - Shared materials: Changing the properties will affect the appearance of all instances using this material.

//   * Clones the material and creates a unique material with independent **user properties**.
//   * Note that external properties might still be shared between materials.

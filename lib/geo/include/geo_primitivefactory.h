/**!
 * @brief
 * Factory for creating primitive types. Primitive types are elementary and
 * useful 3d shapes that are created based on the defined properties. These
 * shapes are therefore not loaded from a scene file format (such as *.fbx).
 *
 * @details
 * All primitive types are created with xz plane taken as the ground plane.
 * Width goes to positive X-axis, height to positive Y-axis and depth to
 * negative Z-axis.
 * The center of the shapes is always at the origin. This means everything else
 * except shapes on the flat XZ plane, need to be elevated up by half the height
 * if you want them to be aligned on the ground plane y = 0.
